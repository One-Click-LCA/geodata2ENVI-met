name=Geodata to ENVI-met
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=This plugin lets you export ENVI-met model areas from geodata, run microclimate simulations from QGIS and also enables you to visualize climate model results in QGIS

about=ENVI-met is a three-dimensional microclimate model designed to simulate the building-surface-plant-air interactions in urban environment
      Typical areas of application are Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Building Design or Environmental Planing, Science and many more...
      <br>ENVI-met is a prognostic model based on the fundamental laws of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. The model includes the simulation of:
      <ul>
      <li>Flow around and between buildings
      <li>Exchange processes at the ground surface and at building walls
      <li>Building physics
      <li>Impact of vegetation of the local microclimate
      <li>Bioclimatology
      <li>Pollutant dispersion
      </ul>
      With ENVI-met, you will be able to simulate the urban microclimate as an interactive system consisting of dozens of dynamic subsystems ranging from atmospheric dynamics, over soil physics, vegetation response down to building indoor climate.
